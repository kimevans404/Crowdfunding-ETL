# Crowdfunding-ETL

For this challenge, we are helping Britta from Independent Funding, a fictional crowdfunding platform for funding independent projects or ventures.
Independent Funding has been growing, so now it needs to perform analysis and create reports for company stakeholders as well as individuals who donate to projects. 
To perform the analysis, this code was created to extract, transform, and load data by:

- Creating an ETL pipeline that moves raw data to a SQL database.
- Extracting data from an external file by using Python and Pandas.
- Cleaning and transform data by using Python and Pandas.
- Designing a database and a table schema by using an entity relationship diagram (ERD).
- Loading data into a PostgreSQL database.
